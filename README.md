📊 Objectives & Use Cases
Regression: Predicting Attraction Ratings

Predict user rating for an attraction.

Help platforms improve services and recommend suitable attractions.

Classification: Visit Mode Prediction

Predict visit purpose (e.g., Business, Family).

Tailor marketing and resource planning.

Recommendation System

Suggest attractions using:

Collaborative Filtering

Content-Based Filtering

Hybrid Systems

📂 Data Sources
Includes multiple datasets:

Transaction, User, City, Attraction, Visit Mode, Continent, Country, Region, Item (Attractions)

🔧 Approach
Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, format consistency, correct outliers.

Preprocessing – Encoding, normalization, feature engineering.

EDA – Visualizations and insights on demographics, ratings, visit modes.

Model Training

Regression: Predict attraction ratings.

Classification: Predict visit mode.

Recommendation: User-item and content-based.

Model Evaluation – R², MSE, Accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, MAP.

Deployment – Streamlit app for prediction, recommendation, and visualization.
